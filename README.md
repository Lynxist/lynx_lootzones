# lynx_lootzones
A resource for spawning objects when entering polyzones

# I use this to spawn loot to be used with [HRS_loot](https://hrs-scripts.tebex.io/package/5347769) but you can use it however you'd like.

**spawnChance = 1.0 will always spawn when entering the zone**
**spawnChance = 0.1 will be 10% chance of spawning** 

Because of HRS loot deleting objects once they've been looted hrs loot removes them if they do try to spawn again when entering a specified zone

I've only just uploading the way I use it currently, I'll remove that soon and set up an example zone.

If you're having trouble setting up a zone just lmk
